    @fn get_asset_turnover_ratio
    @brief The asset turnover ratio is an efficiency ratio that measures a companyâ€™s ability to generate
    sales from its assets by comparing net sales with average total assets. In other words, this ratio shows how
    efficiently a company can use its assets to generate sales.
    The asset turnover ratio is calculated by dividing net sales by average total assets.
    The total asset turnover ratio calculates net sales as a percentage of assets to show how many sales are
    generated from each dollar of company assets. For instance, a ratio of .5 means that each dollar of assets
    generates 50 cents of sales.
